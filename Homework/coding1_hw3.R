# In this assignment we are interested if 
# Males go more frequently to doctors than females. In order to answer this question we do an analysis on
#   a cross-section data originating from the 1977â€“1978 Australian Health Survey.

# 0) Clear work space
rm(list = ls())

# 1) Load tidyverse and modelsummary packages and install and load the "AER" package
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("modelsummary")
library(modelsummary)

install.packages("systemfonts")

# Load the data of doctor visits from AER package (more info: https://rdrr.io/cran/AER/man/DoctorVisits.html)
install.packages("AER")
data("DoctorVisits", package = "AER")
df <- DoctorVisits
rm( DoctorVisits )

# 2) Make a quick data summary on all the variables
summary( df )
datasummary_skim( df )

# 3) Make descriptive statistics on the variable visits conditional on the gender

datasummary( visits *  gender  ~ Mean + Median + sd + min + max + N , data = df )


# 4) Create a ggplot where you display the conditional distributions of visits given the gender
ggplot( data = df ) +
  geom_histogram( aes( x = visits ) , fill = 'navyblue', bins = 20 ) +
  labs(x = "Visits",
       y = "Count" )



# 5-6) Would you consider this a useful graph? Use instead a stacked bar graph!
#   a) create a new tibble, which groups by gender and visits and count the cases (summarise)
as_tibble(df)
new_df <- df %>% group_by(gender, visits)

new_df2 <- new_df %>% summarise(Total = n())

#   b) create a ggplot using aux with the geometry: geom_bar. 
#       You should specify the following arguments: stat = "identity", position = "fill"

ggplot( data = new_df2 ) +
  geom_bar( aes( x = gender , y = Total) , fill = 'navyblue', stat = "identity" ) +
  labs(x = "Visits",
       y = "Count" )


# 7) Test whether the number of visits are the same for male and female
#   Hint: check the t.test function and use `~` sign to define the two groups.
#   You should have a Welch-Two Sample t-test and its results.
ttest <- t.test(visits ~ gender, data = new_df2)
